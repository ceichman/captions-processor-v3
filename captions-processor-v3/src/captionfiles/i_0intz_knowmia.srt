121
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,830
OK, I'm welcome.

122
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,050
Welcome to this class.

123
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm on CSA 473 S?

124
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,896
An introduction to computer networks. Now, I'm not sure if everybody

125
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:26,550
has their cameras off or. I don't see many faces here.

126
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,046
Most of the faces are. Expected here, not here.

127
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:36,534
At least I want to experiment this time with all the we have had the

128
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:42,100
cameras on in all our previous courses, but we never had 70 students in one course so.

129
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,860
So maybe maybe it will be difficult to see 70 faces,

130
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,520
but I still want to see everyone. And dumb.

131
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,280
I want to see your reaction because that

132
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,040
is how I change my speed change my phone,

133
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,595
change my top. And right now I think

134
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:08,380
maybe I'm limited to 25.

135
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:15,350
Let's see five 5 * 525 on one screen.

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,470
And.

137
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,640
25 on other steam.

138
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,033
And and and about 25 people have not done.

139
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:31,033

145
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:51,100
[no speech detected]

146
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,750
Alright, you are muted. Yeah yeah I. I don't know if anything is.

147
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,269
Maybe zoom is in. Did you hear the in the beginning

148
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,220
part of it? Honey, yes. Did you hear the beginning part of it?

149
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,656
Yes, yes we did. OK, all right I. I think Zoom is probably not

150
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:17,140
capable of showing all the faces.

151
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,396
And so while I was going

152
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:24,582
through all the phases, it.

153
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:30,744
It kind of crashed and I'm. And then came back.

154
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:36,780
But I don't see my screen anymore, so let me see what happened to my screen.

155
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,610
OK, my screen is there. And dumb.

156
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,184
It's not shared. Let me see

157
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:51,292
what happened with shared part. If not shared, shared.

158
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:57,770
Screen through share. Now let's finish shared. OK,

159
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,620
so I so it's it's quite possible that it is.

160
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,110
It is not possible to see every face OK, but.

161
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,984
While giving a lecture, it's really. Good for the teacher or the instructor to

162
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:18,190
get a feedback which comes continuously.

163
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,620
By looking at people's faces.

164
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,240
OK, that's a very important feedback.

165
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,570
So as many of you as them, and I think what zoom is probably doing is it is rotating.

166
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,395
I don't know what it is doing, but basically I see only 25 faces and then the other 25 faces are

167
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:43,260
in the next screen and the next screen I have to press them buttons.

168
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,420
But let's continue. So thank you for.

169
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,548
Coming to this class. One of my computers is still coming up. It decided to change the BIOS

170
00:09:55,548 --> 00:10:01,900
light at the last minute, so let me just see 0613.

171
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,280

196

197
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,450
[no speech detected]

198
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:38,030
[no speech detected]

199
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,948
OK, so welcome. We have 71 people.

200
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:49,412
I think if five days, four or five days there are 65 students, 66 students,

201
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:54,942
which is probably the registration. So welcome to this class and 473 and

202
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:59,384
all of you have asked questions and there are plenty of questions so we

203
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:03,892
will be busy for the next one hour. And that's the beauty of flipping

204
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:10,780
the class that most of you already know what I wanted to talk about. But there are so many questions

205
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,270
that cannot could not have been answered in a physical class in

206
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,896
a regular class unflipped class. OK, so I'm going to move on to the

207
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:24,332
first slide where there is a question.

208
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:30,580
[no speech detected]

209
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,996
OK, so this is slide #3 and the question is how are all fields

210
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:42,980
related to each other only through networks or by other means as well? Does one impact the other?

211
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,270
So I listed all these fields here that depend upon computer networking.

212
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,260
And none of these would have been possible if there was no networking.

213
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,426
And so one enables the other distributed computing as possible by networking and

214
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:01,320
with distributed computing came big data and then clear cloud computing and all that.

215
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,100
So there is a lot of interrelationship.

216
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,610
But at the base of all this is not working. Which network based areas of

217
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,760
computing make the most money? Now the money making part is not only the technology.

218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,739
There are marketing issues, there are company issues, their management issues.

219
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:26,599
And all that. OK, and so right now the company

220
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,280
that is making the most money in

221
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,450
the world number one is Apple. And you know what they sell?

222
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,201
They sell networking communication OK,

223
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:44,630
they sell phones that do Internet. OK, now there are a lot of other companies that do the same thing,

224
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,410
but they don't make that much money. So there are so many issues. But in spite of all that.

225
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,880
They are and they make money only when they sold networking before that.

226
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,190
In the Mac business they never made money they last month.

227
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,580
Alright, now you can still ask questions and I'm monitoring the chat box.

228
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,670
So you can ask the question in the chat box.

229
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,060
And and everyone is allowed to

230
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,960
even unmute and ask. And dumb.

231
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,060
OK. Alright, so. Next slide.

232
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,726
What are some examples of networking related

233
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:36,930
job roles that some would apply for? Well, my favorite job would be in networking professor.

234
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,520
Of course. And then the next one is networking researcher.

235
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,930
Networking administrator data center support in the data center you need lot of people.

236
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,464
Lot of people who need to know networking. Cloud computing cloud basically

237
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:57,880
anything to do with the cloud. They need lot of people who need networking and if we want

238
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,792
to do nothing sit in your home. You can write an app. Delighted to network if you are write

239
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:07,480
an app you need to know networking OK in addition to learning programming.

240
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,356
But lot of people are making money that way. OK, so. So networking is there.

241
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:19,516
I mean you I I don't know if you can write networking without no, but you can write much of the

242
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:22,797
computing you can do without knowing how TCP IP works or how you connect

243
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:27,640
from one computer to the next. Or you know what is an IP address.

244
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,500
And then you know what is the difference between Ethernet and Internet.

245
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,380
If you don't know these things, I don't know. You can go very far,

246
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,888
so this is basic fundamental knowledge today.

247
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:45,240
[no speech detected]

248
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,512
Next question. And this is on Slide 5. And I'm saying it's slide numbers

249
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:56,214
because oftentimes zoom. Zoom has bugs

250
00:15:56,214 --> 00:16:02,210
and it will not move this slides, so if I if if you're not on the Slide 5, then you can let me know.

251
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:08,050
So the slide #5 is the Ethereum built on Ethernet.

252
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,382
Any relationship between them. So Ethernet is different than Internet. OK I will. That will become

253
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:18,830
clearer in this second lecture. But right now I'm going to use word Internet.

254
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,370
All cryptocurrencies are possible, but only because of the Internet.

255
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,470
Right, in fact, everything that is virtual today is possible because of the Internet.

256
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,540
Without Internet there is no virtual thing.

257
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,060
OK, virtual shopping, virtual education. Virtual currency.

258
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,118
Virtual travel virtual classes, nothing. Everything, the word virtual means Internet based.

259
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:53,774
OK, what do you think are the limitations

260
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,645
of the current network paradigm? The software, hardware limit politics

261
00:16:57,645 --> 00:17:02,990
are and how can we breakthrough them? Well, that's a very generic question,

262
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,985
and all of the above are issues. OK, and basically the way it works is that there are issues in this

263
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:12,280
software that issue in the hardware that issue in the development that

264
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,320
issues in the marketing that issues and everybody picks up the issues that their best qualified for.

265
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,874
OK. So everybody picks up the issues

266
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:28,870
and they make the they make the change the world in that direction,

267
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,680
and so they make they benefit from it. The world benefits from them.

268
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,400
It's a two way St and so if you are a hardware person you can change.

269
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,050
There are lots of issues in networking. If you're a software person,

270
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,680
there's lots of issues in networking. If your systems person there are lots of issues there OK,

271
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,660
and you have a political person. There are lots of issues there too. OK, today in the frontline news,

272
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,370
the airlines. And the phone companies are fighting,

273
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,510
you know, for what? Anybody?

274
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,512
That's a networking issue. OK, and we talk about those issues. Actually exactly those issues,

275
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:11,070
interference issues and all that in our networking wireless networking course.

276
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,970
So there are three of Valentine's. Why did we use the word adopt during your lecture?

277
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,306
It sounds like a passive world. Why can't a company invent new paradigm

278
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:23,310
only to adopt but only to adapt to it?

279
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:29,410
Yes, you can invent a new paradigm. And and and most people

280
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,000
will basically adapt to it. So one company invented Internet.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,470
I actually one university invented Internet. Or maybe a group of universities in invented Internet?

282
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,070
I mean the Internet was. I mean I, we'll go through that history at some point,

283
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,790
but most people just join the stream, join the, join the flow.

284
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,370
[no speech detected]

285
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:01,176
OK. So. So majority of the world just joined the flow. Now here's the thing.

286
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:05,062
If you are in a company and I've had company of my own, when you have

287
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,200
your company you have to change. You have to change every day.

288
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,318
You have to see where the world is going. If you don't change you will find

289
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,840
yourself out of date and the company that I was working for a big company,

290
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,551
Digital Equipment Corporation went out of business because they could not adapt or they could

291
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:26,500
not change when the PC came. They were in the mini computer business

292
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,960
and they changed the whole world from big computers to minicomputers,

293
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,193
but then they could not change the same person who is the president of my company.

294
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:39,240
He could not change. He could not imagine that everybody will have a computer on their desk.

295
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,210
Why there is a need for a computer on the desk?

296
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,992
Right? So, so The thing is, if you don't adapt you, you die.

297
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:55,160
This is true for the companies. For academics it is less true. I will tell you what I know.

298
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,646
Lot of professors who have not changed anything in the last 40 years because they just know whatever

299
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:02,680
they know and they just keep you know digging more deeper in that.

300
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,247
So I'm only half an academic. Alright,

301
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:15,010
and so I will tell you that basically, even the academics have to adopt.

302
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,386
I have to change every year my field changes. I'm a networking person,

303
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:23,030
but if you see my team how much networking they know they know a lot of networking,

304
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,670
but they know a lot of AI. They know a lot of blockchain. They know a lot about other things.

305
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,225
Whatever is hot, we have to combine.

306
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:34,720
[no speech detected]

307
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,260
OK alright. So that was the point.

308
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,530
Next slide on 76.

309
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:50,070
So their hype cycle here and this is 2019. I will show you 2022 at the end.

310
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,310
And by the way, this changes slides will also be uploaded today, so you will see them.

311
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,995
But basically this one was more interesting than 22 because it has many

312
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:07,220
things that you already know about now.

313
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,528
Alright, so it says are there technologies that are vital, but since they don't bear economic

314
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:19,416
interest that's don't get funding from VC. And the answer is yes. If it is not money making this

315
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:23,290
is will not go there and those things are mostly in Africa.

316
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:29,620
Are less developed world. Where there is no Internet and we need Internet.

317
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:35,084
They need Internet, but who will? Who will provide them the Internet? So some humanitarian societies

318
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:41,740
have to work on those, and they're working on those.

319
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,500
Alright, so yes, like any other field,

320
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,121
there are areas that are not money making,

321
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:55,490
but they are still good. Still worthy

322
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,465
how could be involved? How can we? How could we get involved in these hot topics as a student

323
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:08,294
or worker in the industry? Or how to improve our self after graduation? Now here's the mantra.

324
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:15,030
You got to change every year.

325
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,230
You got to change every year. You got to find out where the world is going and and lead it.

326
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:27,141
There lead lead us there. If you are, if you if you if you are not

327
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:32,915
looking then you will be left behind in my day is when I was growing up. The world used to change

328
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:38,560
in four 5-10 years right? If you should take three months to find a paper, if I want to read a paper,

329
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,284
you know I have to go through lots of correspondence with the author this dad and say he wrote,

330
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:47,730
wrote a paper, send it to me. And millions to take three weeks to get it there.

331
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:53,450
Right now I can find a paper in zefi and you know. And and and The thing is,

332
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,284
the world is changing too fast. So you are a product of a fast

333
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:02,865
dynamic world and you have to be fast and dynamic.

334
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:08,538
Understand. So, so that's

335
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:13,630
how it is is that you have to reevaluate directions every year, and that's what I do.

336
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,626
That's what we do. Every year we look at what is

337
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:22,668
hot and we work on those areas. And this is true for academics and

338
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:26,120
true for industries as well, right?

339
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,642
Next it's like #9. It has been a long time since

340
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:38,530
auto driving has been invented, but people like us. It still seemed far away from it.

341
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,110
Why is it not so common everywhere in the world? What are the limitations of that?

342
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,449
Will it be possible to be to be to manifest

343
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:49,560
to be the manufacturer or something else?

344
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,118
Well, the new technologies just don't require only inventors. OK,

345
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:58,792
after the inventors you need the engineers. After the New Years you need the

346
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:02,760
market years after the market years. You need people who can make them, who can manufacture them,

347
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,071
who can sell them and and the biggest

348
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:10,030
of all the customers who need them.

349
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,070
And any of those can be a bottleneck. Particularly the customer if they don't

350
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,230
need it, you and you still want to sell it, then you have to show them what is the trade off?

351
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,380
What is it that they gain that they buy? Putting that money into your thing?

352
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,220
Right, and so every technology goes through that battle.

353
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,960
And some die, some survive, some come come back after 50 years.

354
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,340
I will tell you what this whole photophone the one that you are using right now.

355
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,432
This photo phone was discovered 30 years ago. AT&T offered this service.

356
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:47,120
You could see your friends on the phone.

357
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,520
30 years ago, but did anybody say no? They gave us $30 a minute.

358
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,060
And so so the idea is that the cost has to come down. The manufacturing has to come down,

359
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:04,410
volume production has to happen, then the technology comes back. Comes in.

360
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,920
That's a very generic term thing, right? Now I'll tell you what is virtualization,

361
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,730
so I have given lectures in these classes 95. I gave a lecture and running

362
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,540
Internet came in and I said look the Internet is charging virtualization.

363
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,588
We will have virtualized started my virtual classes in 1995. I still have recording on my website.

364
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:28,730
[no speech detected]

365
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,608
1695 is 21 + 36 years ago. As soon as the Internet started transmitting video, I transmitted it.

366
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:41,616
Right, but the idea is only saying of

367
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:46,500
virtual and we're saying and we were seeing we put 4C and we could say that OK,

368
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,720
everything will be virtual is happening. Will be virtual education really

369
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,270
virtual blah blah blah blah, but nothing happened for 35 years until the COVID came in.

370
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:01,760
Now it's not a question, basically it's in a city.

371
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,490
It's a necessity now,

372
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,980
and so now everybody is virtual.

373
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,150
[no speech detected]

374
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,181
Alright, and I will share your secret. Right now in my family we have

375
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:24,638
covered right and we are all triple boosted and everything else. I'm not one of those who don't

376
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:30,910
believe in vaccination etc. But we still got it. But I am giving the classes.

377
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,896
There is no problem. This was not possible. If it was a physical class.

378
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:38,350
[no speech detected]

379
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:43,762
Right, so virtualization has its virtues, its necessities, and the

380
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:47,690
technologies may come or come later, or come whenever they are needed

381
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,430
and and the cost effectiveness is the one of the things right now. Virtually virtual is so cheap.

382
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:58,890
I mean, last year I attended at least 3040 conferences, I gave a talk at 30-40 conferences.

383
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,650
International conferences. I spoke in Moscow. I spoke in China. I spoke in India.

384
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,635
I spoke so many countries, but didn't go anywhere from my room.

385
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:13,360
This was not possible before that people said, oh, you can't have a conference.

386
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,762
You know which is virtual. But virtual conferences are free cheap. And very wide ranging,

387
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:24,236
so we are the sellers of the virtual. We are networking eyes.

388
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:31,218
We are the start of the virtual we we started virtualization. We believe in virtual.

389
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:36,580
[no speech detected]

390
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,025
OK. Alright, so how long do you think it takes from a new theory to manufacturing which can be used

391
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:47,700
around most people worldwide? For example 6G? Well, I told you the whole list,

392
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,160
necessity and cost are often the bottleneck or the obstacles. If if people don't feel necessary they

393
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,925
will not take it and the cost is not zero, it they won't take it. I mean it.

394
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:01,005
Basically it doesn't have to be 0 but it cannot be more than

395
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:07,860
what they pay today. In fact, when we were doing Ethernet.

396
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,737
And I was one of the people in the team which was inventing which was

397
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:18,191
designing Ethernet back in 1980. At digital equipment and they told

398
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:23,510
us in mantra they said OK if you want to provide if you want to have

399
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,950
something new you should provide 10 times the speed for two times the cost.

400
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,150
That was the mantra that I started when I was myself learning and student,

401
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:37,710
and you know, really starting out after my PhD. So 10 times the cost.

402
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,050
So we already had 10 Mbit Ethernet and we were designing 100 Mbit Ethernet.

403
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,034
It's 100 Mbit, Ethernet cannot be 10 times if it is 10 * 10 Mbit,

404
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:51,606
people will not buy it. They would rather buy 20 Mbit

405
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:58,460
and then 30 Mbit and 40 Mbit. Why would they buy 1000 Mbit?

406
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,075
Right so. That was the mantra was given that the cost has to be so less

407
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:09,243
basically two times for 10 means. Now people are going to say why they twice just buy the 1000

408
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:13,550
megabit and we're done with it.

409
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:19,430
Right, and so that is not a general mantra, but basically cost is the main thing.

410
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,134
If the cost is such that they are going to save money, a lot of money,

411
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:25,040
then they will come running after you.

412
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,160
[no speech detected]

413
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,106
Page down. Slide number 11 and I'm going fast because you guys have asked lots of questions

414
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:39,840
and you will see the right away. The benefit of flipping the class.

415
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,240
None of this discussion would have been possible in a unflipped class.

416
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,650
In the unflipped class we hardly cover the words on this slide.

417
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,239
OK, and people are so passive that they will not ask any questions.

418
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:01,130
[no speech detected]

419
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:07,330
Alright, so slide #11 is being a smart device, a prerequisite to being an intelligent device.

420
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:13,329
No, those are two different rates. Intelligence means AI,

421
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:19,060
smart means network.

422
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,490
And you could have all four possible combinations 00011011.

423
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:30,910
OK, you could have devices. They are neither smart.

424
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:37,680
Not intelligent, those are most of the things that we used ten years ago.

425
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,280
You could have devices that are smart. Those are all the things that I have around me.

426
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,880
Everything in my house almost everything is smart, including the can, the fan,

427
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,980
the lighting, the cameras, the whatever you name it. They make it. I have it.

428
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,430
[no speech detected]

429
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:01,520
OK, intelligence is coming in. Intelligence is coming in my

430
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,242
thermostat says it is intelligent. Hopefully it is and so it it regulates

431
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:13,350
the temperature. Automatically. Depending upon where I am.

432
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,976
If I go to a different room, it makes the temperature there better

433
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:20,990
and then here another so intelligence Ji.

434
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,810
OK, does this shift from smart, intelligent, require any additional improvement in networking?

435
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,430
Well, it is both ways. Basically, networking is also becoming intelligent,

436
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:38,190
so all the devices like your routers, your phone and whatnot, they are and any networking.

437
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:44,480
In general, the data centers they're adopting AI. We are working on those things now.

438
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,888
Security is making AI. So we are adopting. We are adopting the latest to become

439
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:55,630
the latest to keep up the latest. And this is like I said,

440
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,220
if you don't adapt you die. Same thing happens with technology.

441
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,490
If the technology doesn't adopt it dies.

442
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,360
It failed if it doesn't adapt, it dies.

443
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,244
OK, so the networking field right now, lot of research and all the researchers

444
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:16,048
actually that I know of are working on AI.

445
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:22,740
Adopting AI to networking

446
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,376
and of course networking. Now The thing is, you can do AI. So next question was

447
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:31,660
somewhere I think here can. Yeah right up there you can have AI without networking.

448
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:38,220
I have computer which can just do all my AI work without connecting to the Internet.

449
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,439
But basically all this. I mean in this day and age I can't think of my doing anything

450
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:48,460
without being connected much.

451
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:54,980
It is down. Do you ever foresee soldiers fighting in these soldiers fighting in the battlefield,

452
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,424
being obsolete, and warfare fought entirely remotely by drones, missile, cyber warfare, etc?

453
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:05,769
Well, it is happening now. What do you think Russia is doing in Ukraine?

454
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:08,800
[no speech detected]

455
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,160
While they have they have they have the military people standing by,

456
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,140
but they are already attacking the network.

457
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,460
They already had a network attack last week. And what is happening between China between,

458
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,480
let's say India and Pakistan every day the same thing the war is fought not on the battlefield.

459
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,857
Well on the battlefield too, but mostly on the Internet. What do you think Russia did in

460
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:39,901
the last election election before? They're not going to. They don't need even money

461
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,638
to change the world. They can just change the world by Internet.

462
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,570
[no speech detected]

463
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:53,245
Right, so the Internet is the most. Potent weapon if you want

464
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:58,530
to use it. In that way.

465
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:04,000
OK, so the hackers,

466
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,260
do you think hackers will become more prevalent as a smart technologies,

467
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,471
computing etc. Become widely used? What steps can be our companies would

468
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:17,380
take to prevent this in the future? So let me just tell you hackers are not bad people.

469
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:24,290
Hackers are really intelligent people. You can't be a hacker if you're not intelligent.

470
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,920
There are probably more intelligence, most intelligent people in this society.

471
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,337
The word hacker sounds negative, but it is not. Hackers could be called inventor and

472
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:39,872
if you wanted to call them that way. And so the hacker are the people

473
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:44,313
who try things that normal people will not even do or try, right?

474
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:48,750
So they they they they find out the weakness and they try to see what weaknesses.

475
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:55,074
Now there are what we call good hackers and bad hackers. Bad hackers will generally

476
00:34:55,074 --> 00:35:00,640
use it for their advantage, but the good hackers will use it for the advantage of this society.

477
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,120
So giving in that conference that we are talking about, I went there. That is where they showed me.

478
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,580
They showed me. Actually these people were from Saint Louis. They showed us in the conference

479
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,540
how to break in a car.

480
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,085
5 miles away. Now, is that good or bad? That's good, because now the

481
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:27,982
cars people have to be careful. And 1st, the car people deny the

482
00:35:27,982 --> 00:35:33,180
car manufacturer denied they don't. There is no such thing and then later on they fixed it.

483
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,944
So The thing is, and these people didn't make any money out of it. They are good people.

484
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:43,500
Why would they talk in a conference when they such weaknesses, if they wanted to make money,

485
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,180
they would just go and stop the car and add the money and then take the money and get out.

486
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,940
So Hacker word is not bad. Hacker simply means intelligent, smart,

487
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,894
whatever you want to call them inventive, they try to find the weakness and they

488
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:07,070
bring out and then then the world changes. So do your personal use.

489
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,346
A lot of smart devices. I have met people who work in the security space who will not

490
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:16,110
use them due to the possibility of these attacks occurring well. I am an early adopter.

491
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,780
I use things when the day,

492
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,112
I can get lay my hands on them. But use technology wisely

493
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:33,510
to avoid security pitfalls. So let me tell you what I don't use.

494
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,860
So for example, cloud based things are used only when necessary.

495
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,888
So I have cameras in my house that required. Everything that is going on

496
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:50,530
around one mile of my house, every single inch however. There is an option in every camera

497
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:57,478
to record it in the in their cloud. That's a privacy hazard.

498
00:36:57,478 --> 00:37:02,480
[no speech detected]

499
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,251
Right and so other than one or two cameras and one or two cameras which

500
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:11,845
are pointing in the right direction, I don't record on the cloud because

501
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:17,100
I don't want that privacy violation. But I use the camera.

502
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:23,390
And I use only those cameras that offer me both options and option to reuse without the cloud.

503
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,030
Right local storage. Similarly.

504
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:34,911
Microsoft Office 365. I don't use 365. I use Microsoft Office, which is permanently

505
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:38,610
installed on my computer, and every option that says we can help you with this.

506
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,456
We can help you with that. We can help you with that. I just turn it off because I don't

507
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:46,128
want all my words to go to Microsoft. And then analyze there.

508
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:51,837
And then we told that you did this wrong. This this right? OK,

509
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:56,723
everything I do on my computer is actually being analyzed by thousand other companies 'cause

510
00:37:56,723 --> 00:38:01,410
there are everybody analyzing it. Google is analyzing it. Apple is analyzing it,

511
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:07,800
Microsoft is analyzing it. Everybody knows that yesterday I bought a dishwasher.

512
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,300
Right, everybody knows. And then what happens is when I go to someplace,

513
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,460
I just get the ads related to whatever I bought or something related to that.

514
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,926
So right now. Basically I want

515
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:28,858
to minimize that kind of effect. Hello so I it's not that I

516
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:33,345
don't use the cloud but I use cloud wherever necessary. If there's a non cloud option and

517
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:39,600
it is equally good I will use that. So if local computing is an option, why do I do cloud computing?

518
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,800
I will do cloud computing too when it is not an option.

519
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,820
Alright, now I think I'm going to fast. There are no questions, right?

520
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:55,989
So I'm just continuing and we have plenty to discuss. Slide 15 wow.

521
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:01,818
How is the hackers conference not illegal? If hackers are informed on the

522
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:07,310
waste in which to cause corruption? Well, these are the conferences to learn.

523
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,167
I go there in these conferences. They talk about weaknesses in the current

524
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:14,590
world and it is suitable for the society. It is good for the society.

525
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,960
And have you ever had anything for fun?

526
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,030
We teach hacking in our networking security course. Give you an example why I students,

527
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:32,860
one of my my students do some project work and one of the projects they did was to develop a.

528
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,313
To develop a develop a system in which they will just put their laptop

529
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:42,970
near whatever your favorite coffee shop is and and then people will

530
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,130
connect to the free public Internet.

531
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,150
[no speech detected]

532
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,630
Right, and then when they connect they will pass it on to the real public Internet,

533
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:00,810
except unless it is going to Bank of X, ** if ghost Bent Bank of X ** they could

534
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,672
just produce take you to a fake website. And collect your password and say

535
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:12,450
sorry the system is down right now.

536
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,620
Is it legal? No, it's not legal. I don't think if they put it somewhere they will go into jail,

537
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,910
but is it OK to practice it? Yes. Now what is the purpose of practicing it?

538
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:28,709
Because now you know that you should never connect to free public Internet.

539
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:33,630
[no speech detected]

540
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,160
You got it. And this is what I want to see.

541
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,995
The face is shaking. Alright,

542
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:44,730
and I don't see much shakings I don't know.

543
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,940
But basically this is hacking is not bad, it's just if you bad

544
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,862
application I feel like guns. Guns are not bad and I don't own any guns. Guns are not bad,

545
00:40:56,862 --> 00:41:03,360
but if you use the gun for something which is wrong then it is bad.

546
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,300
Right clothes are not bad, but if you use clothes for something that is wrong then it is bad.

547
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:14,460
This applies to everything. Just curious, what topic did you participate at?

548
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,430
The conference is actually the conference was overbooked, overflowing. He has that packed.

549
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,002
I was not able to get into most of the rooms I wanted to get in. You have to go into the you have

550
00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:28,690
to attend one room and then come back and stand in the queue for the next one next hour.

551
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,138
So one hour in the Q one hour inside. That's all we did.

552
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:40,900
Can you teach us how to hack the cloud in the network security chapter?

553
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,540
Not this chapter, but they take the network security course.

554
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,190
Yes, this course is very condensed.

555
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,330
There's a lot to talk about, just without.

556
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:57,985
You know, just fundamentals. In the US, the government, CIA, and Afghan,

557
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:04,342
etc use as the to hire top hackers. Yes, and they were there. They were giving out $2,000,000 if

558
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:07,767
you because in this conference, by the way you are not required to

559
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:13,031
put your tell your name to register. You can register by cash only and you get

560
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,100
a badge which does not have your name.

561
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:22,645
And so nobody knows who is who. Right, I think you saw that in

562
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:27,470
the video so so the idea is when the CIA wants to know their names.

563
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:33,268
They put this $2,000,000 and this thing and then people register for that

564
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:35,759
competition and then they get a job offer.

565
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:42,540
OK, of course, if you are.

566
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,846
If you are really being bonded on The Wanted list then they will also

567
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:51,660
take you to jail right there and this will happen for some people. So basically it both ways.

568
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:58,570
If you are known to be bad then they will take you right there.

569
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:03,790
Out of curiosity, how vulnerable do you think voting machines are given the current controversies?

570
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:10,410
I think voting machines are more secure than manual voting. Now this is a very political topic,

571
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,850
but in the manual voting if somebody took a thousand votes and threw them in the garbage,

572
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:21,780
how will you find out?

573
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,020
Somebody sent you the wrong room and you put your word there.

574
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,500
How did you find out?

575
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,681
Right manual voting has lot more holes than automated voting. Alright,

576
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:39,565
and the automated voting like anything else that is becoming secure and secure

577
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:44,760
and secure and that's why they use it now. Alright, but I'm not going to go there,

578
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,760
but basically that's the idea. Is that technology, I believe more in technology than in humans.

579
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,400
Similarly for auto driving the day auto driving car, I can approve. I can I can I can?

580
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,716
Let's see what I can say. I can basically buy. I would buy it and rather than

581
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:07,350
taking my chances and I don't believe in my driving, I would let it drive.

582
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:12,570
And you don't know that,

583
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,310
but most of the planes that you are flying are being driven automatically.

584
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:22,270
They're all on the autopilot.

585
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,740
Right, so machines doesn't mean they're bad. Actually, they don't have tempers.

586
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:33,350
They don't go to sleep, they don't, I mean. You know they do malfunction,

587
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:38,160
so you have to worry about redundancy and other things. But human people have more malfunction.

588
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,390
Alright, what is this? Well,

589
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,350
we learn more in depth about cloud computing using this class now.

590
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:55,380
If you take 570 recent advances in networking, maybe a little more.

591
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:01,240
OK, so there are many courses after this with more detail. Will you provided?

592
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,270
I'm not sure about the relationship between cloud computing and the Internet.

593
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,957
Well, you can't reach a cloud without the Internet. Period, how will you get the beach

594
00:45:11,957 --> 00:45:17,110
ucloud without the Internet?

595
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:22,564
Right? And so that's the end, that one.

596
00:45:22,564 --> 00:45:26,420
Next month SDN that SDN power.

597
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,765
Newer networking technologies E5G6G? If so, are the traditional network

598
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:36,590
non becoming less relevant? The answer is yes slowly.

599
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,982
So he has 5G uses as D N6G is not here, but it will use as of course it

600
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:45,720
will use as the end and the older technologies are slowly going away.

601
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,994
For example, have you heard of 1G? It doesn't exist anymore.

602
00:45:50,994 --> 00:45:56,570
There was one year I used 1G. I was there when 1G came out. I took at the very first day,

603
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,714
so 1G is there, but we don't use

604
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:06,110
it not but 2G is still here. 2G is still here in all worldwide. That is the common denominator.

605
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,920
Even if you go to Africa and South in any other place, 2G is there.

606
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,216
OK, they're not died,

607
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:20,150
and it's very unlikely to die. But Bungie has gone.

608
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,994
Is this software defined networking decentralized and who is responsible for managing all

609
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:29,920
these connections so SVN is not designed by actually the opposite? SDN is centralized.

610
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,620
And the network manager is responsible for managing the entire network,

611
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,750
so there is this one person sitting here.

612
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,726
Here she is controlling the whole network. And that is the beauty of SDM that

613
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:48,047
one person can control 2000 devices.

614
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:53,890
[no speech detected]

615
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,493
OK, so and that's why the SDN came in because the managing these large

616
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:02,810
networks was becoming very difficult.

617
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:08,160
Maybe there's DN. Everything is centralized.

618
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,667
Since everyone is sharing the same hardware, would there be any any constraint or

619
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:16,849
what will happen if the workload of all the network users exceeds the capacity

620
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:21,658
of the hardware they are sharing? Well, this is true for any sharing when

621
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:26,030
there is more load, there's overload. There is low service and there are crashes.

622
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:32,640
This is even true for even not sharing. When I use my computer like this zoom right now.

623
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,350
And I have most powerful computers that I can buy, right? Probably Noble prize, of course,

624
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,278
and it crashes if I overload.

625
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:47,560
[no speech detected]

626
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Next how would you define a good networking architecture?

627
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,230
If it is good, they will come for it. If it is good, it will be adopted,

628
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:03,540
period. That is the definition of goodness of anything. If it is good, somebody will say,

629
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,337
yeah, this is good and then and you will see more than yourself using it.

630
00:48:07,337 --> 00:48:13,620
[no speech detected]

631
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:19,857
In the core is the course more theoretical or applicational? Could you explain more about what the

632
00:48:19,857 --> 00:48:25,280
course is designed to help us to do? Will it help us build design better computer programs?

633
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,946
So answer is this is a system's course.

634
00:48:29,946 --> 00:48:36,545
OK, so it says CC-473 S. That letter South after the

635
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:43,220
course number is for systems.

636
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,855
OK, and these systems include

637
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:52,416
both software and hardware. And so it is not a software course

638
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:56,804
or a hardware course or a theory. Course theory courses are designated with a key.

639
00:48:56,804 --> 00:49:02,492
OK, it will help you efficiently

640
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:07,410
use networks in your field, including programming. So if you are doing even program,

641
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,214
you have simply interested in programming, you would be able to do more

642
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,760
programming after knowing networking, because now you can program.

643
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:21,625
Things that can run on two computers. At the same time, our

644
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:28,282
communicate between them. OK, so this is and and the problem is

645
00:49:28,282 --> 00:49:34,440
that we're not teaching programming. We're not teaching, actually.

646
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,922
Applications things like that. What we're doing is we're telling you how

647
00:49:37,922 --> 00:49:42,932
the thing works so you use Web every day, but you don't know how it works. Use email every day,

648
00:49:42,932 --> 00:49:49,760
but you don't really know how it works. Right and you are using zoom right now,

649
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,715
but you don't know how it works, right? So what we do is we explain to you what is

650
00:49:53,715 --> 00:49:58,150
required for things to make work and what is required to make video go through it.

651
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:02,750
What is required? You know why you know we didn't have all this before? What new features came in?

652
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,750
What enabled what? So all that knowledge is in this course.

653
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,750
[no speech detected]

654
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:17,570
[no speech detected]

655
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:22,932
Next question. Is it valuable to design a new, better email system?

656
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:28,583
Will NSF support such kind of projects? Well, this is a normal question for anything, not just NSF,

657
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:35,528
you have to show the need and the cost to benefit tradeoff of any idea you want to sell to anyone.

658
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:41,580
OK, if the person on the other

659
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,470
side believes that they will get more than what they are putting in.

660
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,160
They will put their money in.

661
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:57,138
And this is true for NSF 2. OK, NSF is not there to just waste money or the government

662
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,870
money or people money. They really look for. What is the benefit of this?

663
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:08,540
How does this society benefit from here?

664
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,880
So everything is. Cash to benefit.

665
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,365
When should we have the textbook by today? Basically, we'll need it today because

666
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:23,650
the homework that is being assigned today requires you to read chapter one.

667
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:29,099
OK, of course you will not get

668
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:34,314
it today from Amazon or from wherever or from book store. You can go to the bookstore

669
00:51:34,314 --> 00:51:38,488
and pick it up today, but you can also order over mail order or whatever and

670
00:51:38,488 --> 00:51:45,464
you will need it because the homework is due on Sunday. So by Sunday. Well,

671
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:51,520
Sunday is only video review is due. So I mean if you don't have the book,

672
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,812
you can still use the video, but I think it's good to read the book after viewing the video

673
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:03,102
or while viewing the video, because there is a lot more material in the book than in the

674
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:07,419
video and you might have some questions which are not in the video but are in the in the book.

675
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:10,560
[no speech detected]

676
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:17,512
So it is OK to ask any question anytime. Anytime and right now I'm giving a

677
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:23,140
monologue because nobody asking any questions and I'm looking at the chat box.

678
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:29,560
Yeah, go ahead, we can see two questions in the chat box in the chat box against you questions,

679
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:35,692
so my chat box is missing something. Now let me see. Oh my chat box,

680
00:52:35,692 --> 00:52:41,998
I haven't I know what is missing. I won't scroll it. I have to scroll it to go

681
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:48,210
down to the latest question. Alright.

682
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,960
Thank you and by the way, for all the students, honey is my league TA.

683
00:52:53,960 --> 00:53:00,340
There are four or five days on this course, so I mean, is keeping track of all this?

684
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:05,700
Let's see. I will come back to this question. Let me finish this start here about the book.

685
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,620
OK is it digital copy of the test textbook sufficient and OK.

686
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:15,177
So I don't recommend any illegal copies. Please, I'm an author and there are

687
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:20,430
people who wrote the book, their authors, and I'm just like you want to steal.

688
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,710
You don't want somebody to steal your thing. The authors don't want somebody steal their thing.

689
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:31,660
And so as long as you get a legal copy and you can buy a legal copy from from the publisher,

690
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,770
publisher is selling, you know. Soft copies.

691
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:40,148
At access our rental,

692
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:46,112
all kinds of things are possible. OK, but it's it's your own

693
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:51,510
ethics that dictates that.

694
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,418
OK, how unethical you want to be, but that's your choice.

695
00:53:54,418 --> 00:54:00,010
[no speech detected]

696
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,650
When we return to in person class, we still required to watch videos before coming to the lecture.

697
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:10,257
Instead of reading the text well, it's not instead of. The video is not a substitute

698
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:15,210
for reading the text. Both are required. You need to read the text please.

699
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,290
You need to watch the video now. The video has a deadline of midnight.

700
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:24,162
That doesn't mean that your thing starts at midnight stops at midnight. You should really read.

701
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:28,772
Watch the video much before the midnight. You should read the text and then

702
00:54:28,772 --> 00:54:32,790
log all the questions both from the text and from the book until you

703
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:38,430
are sure that you understand enough. If not, you should read the textbook after the Q&A session.

704
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,936
So we'll have Q&A session in which we have discussed every

705
00:54:42,936 --> 00:54:48,900
line with a very fine detail. Right and then you might have a question when you read the textbook,

706
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,360
please do, because without reading the textbook, there's no substitute for that.

707
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:58,300
You have to read the textbook. Alright, the textbook is 800 pages long.

708
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,420
Videos probably will make for 80 pages total.

709
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,620
OK, so it's only a summary of what is in

710
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:11,944
the book and you have to read the book. So video is providing overview of the text.

711
00:55:11,944 --> 00:55:18,468
OK, so this is about the system bus, prerequisite system bus.

712
00:55:18,468 --> 00:55:23,190
So I have learned the term system bus in a computer systems course,

713
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,850
but it was used to describe the transferring of data between the CPU and memory.

714
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:31,830
So how would it be connected to networking? Well, you're doing the same thing.

715
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:37,569
Networking is also an IO device, and so you read and write data to the network devices just

716
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:43,593
like you write it to memory. OK, so you write something into the

717
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:46,882
memory and then you read it back or you reading from the memory and

718
00:55:46,882 --> 00:55:50,222
write it back in different locations, same location, same thing.

719
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:55,960
Networking networking is just another device.

720
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,760
OK, so you can read it from memorial and write it to the network or read that,

721
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,893
read it from the network, write it to the memory and either way I

722
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:07,160
mean lot of things are happening there. You read it from memory, put into the disk.

723
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,146
Disk is another IO device. They're all on the system bus.

724
00:56:12,146 --> 00:56:17,750
[no speech detected]

725
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,290
Milligram papers in the past few years we provided before the exams, no.

726
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:25,410
The answer is no. We will provide you the whole review and all that.

727
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,730
You will have an idea of what the exams are like, but we don't provide

728
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:33,090
these solutions in writing and we don't provide any exams in writing.

729
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:37,430
Would we have in person classes after the first two weeks are totally online?

730
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:44,330
The exams will be in person, so right now the plan is to have exams in person. And so on.

731
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:49,690
The day of exam you will all come to Lopata 101. Sit down next to each other.

732
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:55,398
And and take your chances. But basically, and the reason is last year we

733
00:56:55,398 --> 00:57:02,274
had exam online and the exam online is responders and it works beautifully and there's no problem

734
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:08,476
with it except that you know you really have to get a good camera. You really have to get a camera

735
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:12,065
which is not on your laptop because you know right now even right now

736
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:15,394
it really better that if you have a camera which is not on your laptop. For example,

737
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:21,024
right now my camera is not on the laptop. So now my camera is facing the right

738
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:25,820
angle wherever it's supposed to and my screen is in the right angle that I need to,

739
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:31,520
otherwise I have to adjust the screen up and down so that I can be visible at the same time.

740
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:38,152
I can read this screen. So the two things in one place sometimes are not very good, so and

741
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:42,150
the cameras don't cost anything right now, the cameras are available for $15.

742
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:47,900
I just checked $9.99 on Amazon. So the cameras are not very expensive,

743
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,420
and in fact the companies that I recommended. I mean, there's no need,

744
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,983
but right now they recommend is Logitech. I use logic tech cameras and they

745
00:57:55,983 --> 00:58:02,388
have been around for 40 years. They have the brand name. And and one of the good Logitech

746
00:58:02,388 --> 00:58:07,180
cameras is for $22.95. I mean, what else can you want so so The thing is,

747
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:13,653
these things have come down significantly. When I was when I started at that time,

748
00:58:13,653 --> 00:58:17,260
the camera just $95 a $100. In fact, the camera that I'm using right now.

749
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:23,362
I just got it for $149 this year. So so so there are better cameras

750
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:29,126
and just to get by cameras, it's about $15 or $10 is not bad, but anyway.

751
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:34,580
Right now there is no plan to have exams online.

752
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,350
Exams will be in person, but other than that I think

753
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:43,644
virtual is better. Do I need to read all contents of

754
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:46,957
chapter one through 8 in the textbook, even if some of the content don't

755
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:50,972
let them this slide, in other words, does the exam only test the knowledge in

756
00:58:50,972 --> 00:58:57,184
the slides or book content may be tested. So in these slides we have clearly

757
00:58:57,184 --> 00:59:03,170
identified the sections that you're supposed to read in the book.

758
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,140
There are many sections that we have not. We will not cover and you don't have to read them.

759
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,770
[no speech detected]

760
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:16,940
OK, but if you need to read them, you'll be told.

761
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,428
So it is not the whole book. It is part of the book The Essential

762
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:27,390
part of the book, and that will be clearly identified in the slides. If it is not clear,

763
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,220
you can ask a question. Alright, let me come back to your question here.

764
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:36,775
Actually I am also looking at my clock and I have two things to do to finish all the questions that

765
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:41,124
have been asked and then come back to the chat questions. So I'm going to come back in

766
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:45,480
a minute to chat questions. Actually I have 26. I have more slides to go in there.

767
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,830
OK, so let's see alright grading. Can you explain how the class participation works?

768
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:56,932
Well, class participation means answering questions. If I ask a question, you answer.

769
00:59:56,932 --> 01:00:02,570
Attendance if you're not there, you're not gonna get last class participation and remember,

770
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:07,851
your attendance is not only being taken by zoom, it is also count. It is also monitoring what

771
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:12,890
you are doing while zooming.

772
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:18,250
Right, if you are busy on the other screen watching a movie or doing something else,

773
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:22,359
it monitors that and it lets me know that this person was not paying any attention.

774
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:25,600
[no speech detected]

775
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,810
And I don't. Question, yeah, so like. During a lecture like,

776
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,836
particularly in Zoom Lecture, I like ask and answer questions like or

777
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:39,930
I'll get information for something that I'm like wondering about from the Internet,

778
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:43,100
or I'll drop down my notes in my notepad on my computer.

779
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,450
How does that factor in with? That will be counted and not paying attention. I'll tell you what.

780
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:54,730
Basically I mean it's it is basically saying that what other things are going on,

781
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:01,560
where your mouse is. OK, and so it does not know that you are doing productive work that

782
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,200
you're doing for the course work, or you're doing something else.

783
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,060
Are you at chatting with your friends? It cannot distinguish between the

784
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,890
Facebook and the networking course. OK OK alright how many homework left do we have?

785
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:21,010
We have 26 homeworks and 12 labs. How long do you expect them take all the homeworks are short.

786
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,450
This will not take more than five minutes, but to do that 5 minutes you need five hours of reading.

787
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,421
And I'm just kidding. So you have to read if you know the

788
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:34,950
homeworks are very simple few lines. They're not very long.

789
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:40,110
But you have to know the material. And labs require programming and

790
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:44,930
that they may take some time. OK.

791
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:48,290
And is there a great distribution scheme? I don't know what that means,

792
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:51,397
but you get the points for the method and the result half points half

793
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:55,470
of the points are for the method. If your result is wrong, but the method is right,

794
01:01:55,470 --> 01:02:01,199
you still get half points. And if your method is if your result is right, but you don't,

795
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,068
it didn't show the method or we don't know how you got it or you the wrong way. You got half point.

796
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:12,506
The PowerPoint says that the negative rating

797
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:16,686
on incorrect multiple choice questions grade plus one for correct minus one 4

798
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:20,750
- 1 upon north minus one for incorrect. What does the number N mean?

799
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:26,150
Is the number number of selections? Yes, N is the number of choices in a multiple choice question.

800
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:31,470
For example, and is 2 for true and false. So if you take it true and false,

801
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,690
you get half point minus one.

802
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,440
For incorrect and plus one for correct.

803
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,820
So you cannot just randomly mark. If you Mark randomly, you will get a 0.

804
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:51,430
Do exams involve programming? No.

805
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:55,410
Can we work in Group? Can you work in the groups of two and three for the labs?

806
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,210
All labs are very short programming or data analysis exercises,

807
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:02,450
so in some cases you are analyzing a trace.

808
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:07,650
In the other cases you are. Basically, writing a small program

809
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:12,107
it's not really worth you know, for two or three people to be doing that.

810
01:03:12,107 --> 01:03:18,799
How in depth is the programming? Does it go down to the programming

811
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,381
protocols are using so if you want to look at the labs and homeworks

812
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,682
you can just go back to the previous years lectures and find them.

813
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:27,627
We do change the exercises to the numbers are

814
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:32,090
not the same but you can find them online.

815
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:38,685
All ears lectures including 2005, 678-910-1320 whatever 21st are

816
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:44,520
all online on my website. OK, so you can see preview them.

817
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:51,016
Find out what kind of exercises are labs, those are. OK. What programming language

818
01:03:51,016 --> 01:03:56,460
do we need to learn in order to finish the lab C and Python?

819
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,080
And I know there are people who know only one or the other,

820
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,640
and so I just wanted to tell you beforehand. OK.

821
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,610
Can we see the homework template to clarify the requirements,

822
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:16,185
see the previous years? I'm using if using the code in the homework, that's the whole code needs

823
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:21,375
to be included as well, yes? What format do the homeworks take, either in free responses and

824
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:27,194
multiple choice or true and false? None of the above is calculations. OK, you just do.

825
01:04:27,194 --> 01:04:33,000
You just compute some things and submit the answers.

826
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,330
So how will the solutions to the homework be posted? Well, when neither I will discuss

827
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:43,094
this solutions in the class. We never post any solutions because the minute you post the solution

828
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:46,360
it becomes out of date because everybody has gotten default right

829
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:52,652
and these courses are taken by 2000. Other people who are not in this class. Not for money,

830
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:57,030
I just make it available for free, but The thing is,

831
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:04,020
if and many professors use the same lectures. So we don't publish the solutions,

832
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:10,180
but if you if you need, you can basically and what I do I monitor to.

833
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:15,140
If So what we do is if there is a homework for which most people got it right.

834
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:20,920
That's fine if if some if if the variation is very large, that means a lot of people didn't get it.

835
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,744
This at that. Then we discussed that in the class and and and you will know

836
01:05:26,744 --> 01:05:33,150
what is the right way to do it. But then I posted. If this semester switches

837
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:39,000
to in person instruction, this is the same question.

838
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,630
Will some knowledge only appear in the textbook and not be covered by the lectures?

839
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:47,600
I think we already covered that. Problems even understanding problem 7.

840
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:53,020
So problem 7 is about sine Theta.

841
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:59,100
Well, you need to turn entry for this course. If you don't know, sign and cast sorry

842
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,404
you should drop the course right away because you need to know sine Theta

843
01:06:03,404 --> 01:06:07,320
and that's why the question is here. You need to know binary representation.

844
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:14,220
You need to know what is CPU. You need to know all this.

845
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:20,084
OK, what every video have such quizzes beside the video embedded quizzes? The answer is no.

846
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:24,210
This is only a prerequisite and I put it there so that people can decide.

847
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,135
I mean everything sounds interesting but you need to have background otherwise you will find yourself

848
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:33,360
behind the queue and then you will complain at the last minute. Hey I, I didn't understand that.

849
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:39,200
I didn't understand that, but I understand that you need to have some basic things about computing.

850
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:46,000
This cannot be your first computing course. OK, this is not 131.

851
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,450
Are you required to finish it and upload it to somewhere?

852
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,090
No, this quiz is just for yourself. I would suggest that you take it.

853
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:01,430
I will provide the answers next time. I will provide the answers next

854
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:06,910
time you compare your answers. And if you find that you get minus 5.

855
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:12,890
Just you know, basically think about not continuing the course.

856
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:19,281
OK, so you set your own threshold. And decide this is help you decide

857
01:07:19,281 --> 01:07:21,090
whether you have the background.

858
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:26,870
[no speech detected]

859
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:32,373
When we return to in person classes, will logistic change? No if we were able to start

860
01:07:32,373 --> 01:07:37,255
in person classes in February. Same question, no. Next I have in person classes

861
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:41,628
right before this and after this class would it be ideal for me to

862
01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:45,480
watch the video recording later on? I don't see what is the problem here

863
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,155
because conditions are mandatory. You have to be here and many students

864
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:52,830
join the classes from cafeteria. They're sitting right in the cafeteria.

865
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:56,790
You know, just watching whatever some people go to an empty classroom.

866
01:07:56,790 --> 01:08:01,570
Some people just go to empty space, and if nothing else, you can go to the part of 101. It's empty.

867
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:08,117
OK, so it doesn't take any seconds

868
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:13,220
more than what in person class would you you would be doing.

869
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:17,260
The in person class you cannot attend. Then of course you should not attend this,

870
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:22,360
but this is not an excuse. You have to be here for discussion because

871
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,980
this is where the learning takes place. Let me tell you everybody has seen the video.

872
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:32,700
That is the thing that I repeat every year right and every same thing. I say same words right?

873
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:38,340
And nobody asks any questions but they never got to details.

874
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,680
With this one you get to 10 times more detail into the topic. Then you would be possible

875
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,110
in in unflipped class. So there are two issues here, which are which are not same

876
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:53,390
unflipped and in person unflipped has nothing to do with the in person.

877
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:57,100
Even many courses are done flipped.

878
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:03,708
Even if they're in person. In that case, the flipping out generally means that you read the book.

879
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:09,644
And here what we are doing is we

880
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:14,260
are identifying the topics we are giving you the lecture video and then the book is already there.

881
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,310
You read the book and then you come back for discussion.

882
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:23,107
Alright, should we just come up with silly questions if

883
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:29,120
you normally don't have any? So here thing why did I make one question mandatory?

884
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:35,362
To be able to understand everything in 80 minute class and not have a question is mainly due to

885
01:09:35,362 --> 01:09:38,456
religiousness and not smartness. You cannot be so smart that you know

886
01:09:38,456 --> 01:09:43,513
everything if you know everything. Why are you here? Why are you

887
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:47,668
wasting your time taking this course? So even the idea of asking a silly

888
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:51,540
question is laziness, not smartness. You should really make the best use of time,

889
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:57,384
your own time, not mine. Current time and the best use of the

890
01:09:57,384 --> 01:10:01,460
opportunities that you are getting. You're getting an opportunity to ask a question.

891
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,130
Ask it if you have a question. If you don't have a question, then maybe once in awhile it's OK.

892
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:10,970
But then I had I had I had run these classes without the question so people didn't ask any questions.

893
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:15,500
They just check Mark. Yeah I bought watch the video and they were done.

894
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,880
Then I put the quizzes in there so now they have to watch the video.

895
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,339
At least go to the quizzes and they're done. They don't want to ask anything. Why?

896
01:10:22,339 --> 01:10:25,330
Because they don't know English because they don't want to speak English.

897
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:30,870
They don't want to write in English. Well, I want to get you to get over that hurdle.

898
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:37,388
OK, you won't get education well if

899
01:10:37,388 --> 01:10:41,446
you can't even write a question, you cannot ask a question. So don't

900
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:47,740
don't worry about it silly questions. Alright, I'm basically running time in time,

901
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:54,526
that's why I'm I'm hurrying up page up. Exams will be in person, yes.

902
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:58,740
Will you share your industry experience related to some networking topics?

903
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:03,172
In every lecture you will find a lot of in videos you say we can take the quiz as

904
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:07,095
many times as you want, but in my case, after I fill in my answer and submit

905
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:12,580
the quiz just just gone, I don't. I do not know where to do it again. Is that an updated policy?

906
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:17,380
No, you can review the video anytime. Once you go back and review the video,

907
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,430
your previous grade will be overridden. And if you have watched it once,

908
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:28,130
you know what are the right answers, because everything is true and false and you can just answer

909
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:34,160
it right and you will get 100%. Second time, and that's OK with me.

910
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:39,943
Because basically I want to make sure that you got the you know what the right

911
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:44,986
answer is and you got to the video. What is your favorite part section module

912
01:11:44,986 --> 01:11:49,460
of this course to teach entire course? Every topic builds on the previous one.

913
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:56,020
I can't teach you chapter 2 without chapter one and I can't teach you Chapter 9 without Chapter 7,

914
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,390
and then I can't teach you my next course without discourse.

915
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:07,400
OK so I need you to really follow the whole way through.

916
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,320
Alright, now I'm going to go back to the chat questions. We are one minute beyond time.

917
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:17,570
If you have to leave, I don't know. 2:15 is the time or 220.

918
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:23,930
Honey, you know? At anybody knows what time is the Class 220?

919
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:30,390
I still have 9 minutes. OK, I'm going to go through this. Chat questions.

920
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:36,550
OK, yeah, sometimes you talk about something in life.

921
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:42,758
Then in next minute some app recommends similar items to me. Is there any way we can prevent this

922
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,490
while keeping using keep using the app? So the privacy is gone now.

923
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:53,086
Basically once you use any free app. Any free app and and on my iPhone

924
01:12:53,086 --> 01:12:58,015
have 200 of them use any free app that reason they're free is because they're

925
01:12:58,015 --> 01:13:03,960
making money out of your privacy.

926
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,470
Everybody has to make money. I mean they're not living here just to give you something free.

927
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:12,757
So when you get a free Google driving like Google driving are you get a

928
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:16,655
FREE Email from Google are you get a free this or free that everything

929
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:22,350
has money attached to it and that money comes by selling your privacy.

930
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:28,177
Alright. And so the only way you can do is you can go back and select the proper options so that

931
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:32,780
they cannot monitor your location. They cannot monitor this. Whatever is important to you,

932
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,820
they cannot monitor that and then they will decide whether they want to give you the service or not.

933
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:43,620
What does decentralize Internet even mean that word will come later on when we talk about centralized

934
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:48,970
same question next question. Somebody gave the answer,

935
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:54,250
which is that look up Web 3. Does anybody see lecture to

936
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:59,335
book sections mapping anywhere? Yes, in our class in our class

937
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:04,176
schedule there is a lecture to lecture to Berea and I will

938
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:09,600
share that with you right away. So if you.

939
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,340
Come on. Uhm?

940
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:17,700
[no speech detected]

941
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:23,851
So if you go to my web page class web page. Then they did chapter mapping to the

942
01:14:23,851 --> 01:14:30,400
class chapter 12345678 and exam 123.

943
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,910
OK, next question on the chat box.

944
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:43,300
I'm. Will the court meet in person after first? I think this we discussed five times.

945
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,980
Do we need to use both Python And say yes when we will? When will the office hours begin?

946
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,140
This sinister they will. They will begin as soon as I might.

947
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:57,337
Whole TA Team TA team recruited by the Department department is still

948
01:14:57,337 --> 01:15:01,130
putting people on the on the basically they're putting on the registers.

949
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:06,730
Let me put it this way so we have the team, but some of the Members are still not here.

950
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,810
And and there are other issues as soon as that that is done,

951
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:15,730
and hopefully we'll start the start the.

952
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:22,460
The hours this week. Although I don't know whether you will have that much to do this

953
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:26,836
week because there is no homework other than watch the video. But next week onwards when there's

954
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:32,956
a real homework, people will come. OK, and then we will have the DTA hours.

955
01:15:32,956 --> 01:15:37,750
So other than that I'm that. Is it just a comment from before the class,

956
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:41,208
only 25 phases under video settings you

957
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:47,230
can select 49 participants you are using up. To the data desktop client of

958
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:53,060
zoom your PC supports it OK, Alright, thank you for that tip. I will find out that setting.

959
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:59,380
Let me see if you how do you. How do you. How do you get to 50? Does anybody who wrote this.

960
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,770
Thomas Gibbons. Can you explain where is the option? For 49.

961
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:11,674
You can chat it or you can sleep. Yeah, if you go to your words

962
01:16:11,674 --> 01:16:15,920
close to where it says stop video, you can hit the arrow,

963
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,830
go to video settings. And then on video, just Scroll down to the bottom.

964
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:27,390
And there's a maximum participants in the gallery view.

965
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:32,290
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. See this is a class participation point right there.

966
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:36,870
OK, alright, so now I can see 49 videos.

967
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:43,810
Right this minute I get that. Alright, anything else? I've covered everything.

968
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:50,310
I still have 5 minutes.

969
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,966
Actually, I had some more things to discuss. Yeah, so let me

970
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:57,650
just go back to my presentation.

971
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:05,600
Uhm? Yeah so. Yeah, yeah.

972
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,480
Alright, so after the related modules, there are three slides this time.

973
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,992
And the first is instructions for passing the class video. I already put those so you already have

974
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:22,603
seen those four and then it slides. It slides everything in. This course is public basically in

975
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:26,380
the sense that you know everybody else outside the class also knows about it,

976
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:32,020
so these slides are there. The new slides of today will be put again back under the website,

977
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:37,774
and when the video is ready, the video is being recorded. It will be put back on the website so you

978
01:17:37,774 --> 01:17:43,440
can see when the Q&A videos if you want to. Alright, next is.

979
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,654
Features so you all you know basically that there's a table of contents

980
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:53,730
so you can go to a video and you can jump to any slide you want. You don't have to watch the

981
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:58,536
whole video to go to slide #17. You could just jump to slide #17 there

982
01:17:58,536 --> 01:18:04,160
is a captions you can enable and disable. There is full screen feature so we have

983
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,300
tried to do the latest as much as possible. There is one more page which is not showing up.

984
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:14,460
Let me see what is happening here.

985
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:20,610
Yeah, I don't know why this page did not show up. Tell them yeah.

986
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:27,570
OK, alright, so this is the page, so this is the hype cycle 2021.

987
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,489
This is the latest available from Gardner and by the way we are lucky enough to

988
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:35,230
have the gardener service in Washoe. If you're a Washoe student or professor,

989
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:38,966
you can get this for free in other places would be $5000 for

990
01:18:38,966 --> 01:18:44,870
this same piece of information. Listen, make the best use of it.

991
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:50,548
However, the things that are here right now. Those I mean actually the chart

992
01:18:50,548 --> 01:18:55,650
is not as dense as it was before, so that is makes me unhappy. But then basically, generative AI,

993
01:18:55,650 --> 01:19:02,340
decentralized finance, compressible network, quantum machine learning. So I have marked these areas

994
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,429
basically and this is what I do. Basically I go through these and then

995
01:19:05,429 --> 01:19:09,590
I just want to make sure that I'm not. I'm fully aware of those.

996
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:15,983
And this is what you have to do too. Right, and and if it's starting point

997
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:21,359
for that is just that report itself. You can you can go to that report and that

998
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,480
explains in one paragraph each of these you know doesn't spend too much time.

999
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,560
But then you can follow up more by Google, or you know Wikipedia or whatever.

1000
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:36,610
So that was one thing I wanted to put the latest Gartner chart. I still have two minutes.

1001
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:43,415
Any other questions or comments suggestions? Oh Professor, can you explain

1002
01:19:43,415 --> 01:19:48,550
what the sine function is? What is sine function is this is a sine function right there.

1003
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:53,230
If I dry horizontal line. String Demetri will teach me the sign function.

1004
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:57,700
Looks almost like this and.

1005
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:02,990
And basically this time function is important for this course because

1006
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:08,490
the whole wireless is a waveform. A sine wave form.

1007
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:13,827
So when you get a 5G2G1G3G. And in fact, even this Ethernet

1008
01:20:13,827 --> 01:20:19,860
that is not wireless wired thing. What we do is we send waveforms.

1009
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:26,594
Everything all these signals are wavefronts. So even if you do an off, let's say you have zeros and

1010
01:20:26,594 --> 01:20:31,370
ones when you send to the wires, they become a waveform. Their farm is like a wave

1011
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:35,980
that you put a stone. You put a stone on the on the lake and the wave is formed.

1012
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:42,580
That is a sine function. OK, and. Oh yeah, so that is one thing,

1013
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:46,500
but let me just say I have one more thing which OK 220 minutes is done.

1014
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,020
But let me let me just try this out. Before you I let you go.

1015
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:53,700
If you have to go you can go but.

1016
01:20:53,700 --> 01:21:00,066
Uhm? The. There is an option to ask questions

1017
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:05,912
and I was going to try that out, but I can find it now so more.

1018
01:21:05,912 --> 01:21:12,842
More more more more more OK. Well next time. So basically I want to make sure that

1019
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:17,552
people who are not computer networking people this will not be taking computing, computing people.

1020
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:22,882
This will not be taking this course. You really need to be really

1021
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:26,790
very highly computer literate. To be able to take computer networking course,

1022
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,960
because we assume this all the time.

1023
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:35,068
OK, and second thing if you are, if you are a first year student maybe

1024
01:21:35,068 --> 01:21:39,390
you should not take this course. Maybe you should take it and this is

1025
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:44,920
designed for the 4th year senior students. Right and up. So if you are a senior,

1026
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,050
of course this is the right time right place. Even juniors can take it,

1027
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:54,525
but before that, it's kind of, you know, little bit heavy and people were masters and PHD's.

1028
01:21:54,525 --> 01:22:01,140
This could be heavy for you because our journey our seniors are very smart. OK, just to warn you,

1029
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:06,778
our undergrads are smarter than our grads. This is a fact, and so you are competing with

1030
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:12,245
a very smart crowd. And so just here to work harder if you are

1031
01:22:12,245 --> 01:22:14,320
taking an undergrad course here. Thank you.

1032
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:21,250
Professor, I just have one more question.

1033
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:26,760
How does the sine function relate to the cosine function? Well, he asked in a metro man.

1034
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,384
I mean, I, I'm telling you, you really need to finish that up because

1035
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:35,750
I cannot teach you tecnotree here. But the sign and cosine are very related,

1036
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:39,980
and then these squares add up to one. But the idea is that that is a lot of technology.

1037
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:45,834
There's a lot of math there. And and that is starting high school, actually, I never, I.

1038
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:51,510
I don't think you know these even taught in in here at Washoe. Maybe I know people can tell you.

1039
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:55,550
Your colleagues can tell you where they learned about the sign function.

1040
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,730
But that is a must.

1041
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:03,609
OK, thank you.
